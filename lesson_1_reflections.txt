How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
A)Since it only showed the lines that were changed, I could see the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A)because I will have access to all the changes and can back to a particular change.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A) Pros: we know when we have done a logical change, so manual commit is good
Cons: you may forget sometimes and commit a big/set of changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A) so you have a snapshot of the whole project at commit points

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A) 'git log' shows all the commmits made, 'git diff id1 id2' shows difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
A) knowing that I can revert back to the older versions, gives me more independence to make changes.
